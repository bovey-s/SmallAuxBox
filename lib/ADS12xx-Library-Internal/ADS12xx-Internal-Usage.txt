Layout for ADS1256 Code:

"ADS1256_ATMEGA_BASE.ino" 
 - Interfaces with the ads1256 through the ATEMGA328P
 - Performs single channel measurement (AIN0/AIN1) on LCD 2.1
 - As of writing, Harvinder is adding LCD support to this version
 - Must define "ATMEGA" and comment out "ESP32HUZZAH" in ADS12xx.h to use the library with the ATMEGA

"ADS1256_BASE_CODE.ino"
 - Interfaces with the asd1256 through the ESP32 HUZZAH
 - Has the ability to perform cyclic measurements or single-channel measurements
 - Cyclic measurements is the default
 - To change to single measurements: 
	* Uncomment (send) the STANDBY command in setup
	* Call measureSingle() versus measureCycle()
	* Assign the output of measureSingle() to something (i.e. Resistances[0] = measureSingle(); )
	* Update handleSerialInput() to print only Resistances[0] versus cycling through Resistances[i] for i in [0:3]
 - The sampling rate can be changed as it is a parameter in the adcObject->begin() fxn
 - The ESP32 uses the "TFT_eSPI" library to drive the LCD, which requires a setup file: "User_Setup.h" defined in the library
	* There is an organization fork that you can pull from (https://github.com/Mesomat-inc/TFT_eSPI)
	* Additionally, this library is included as a submodule in the Arduino libraries repo, so you can just pull that as an alternative (https://github.com/Mesomat-inc/libraries.git)
